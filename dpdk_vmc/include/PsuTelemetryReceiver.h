/**
 * @file PsuTelemetryReceiver.h
 * @brief UDP listener that caches the latest PSU measurement packet pushed
 *        by MainSoftware, and prints it as a health-table row.
 *
 * Threading model:
 *   - One background pthread does blocking recvfrom() with a short SO_RCVTIMEO
 *     so stop() is responsive.
 *   - The cache is guarded by a pthread_spinlock; readers (print) take a
 *     snapshot under the lock.
 *
 * Lifecycle: init -> start -> print (repeatedly, from main loop) -> stop.
